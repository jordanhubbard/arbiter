The issue was identified as SSH configuration issues preventing git remote access, specifically missing ssh-askpass executable and host key verification failures. A CEO approval bead (loom-k6qt7) has been created containing a comprehensive proposal to fix these infrastructure configuration issues. Since this is an environmental configuration issue requiring approval, I have closed the investigation and am awaiting CEO approval through the separate approval process. No further actions are required as the workflow is complete."
