title: P1 (sticky) User guide review by personas before release approval
description: |
  This is a sticky, always-on bead for the Arbiter project.

  Goal
  - Ensure the Arbiter user guide is reviewed and augmented by relevant personas
    before any release can be approved by release engineers.

  Rules
  1) Release gating
     - A release cannot be approved unless the user guide has been reviewed and
       updated as needed.
  2) Required reviewers
     - At minimum: documentation-manager, project-manager, and qa-engineer.
     - Additional personas should be included when their domain is impacted
       (e.g., devops-engineer for deployment changes).
  3) Evidence
     - Each release must include a short note in the release checklist or bead
       context confirming the review occurred and describing any updates made.

  Definition of Done (for any release bead)
  - The user guide has been reviewed by the required personas.
  - The guide is updated to reflect any changes in workflows or features.
  - Release approval includes the review evidence.
