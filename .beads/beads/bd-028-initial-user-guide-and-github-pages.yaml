title: P0 - Create initial Arbiter user guide + GitHub Pages publishing
description: |
  Create an initial Arbiter user guide in markdown format, add a GitHub CI/CD
  stage that converts the guide to HTML, and publish it via GitHub Pages.

  Requirements
  - Add an initial markdown user guide under docs/ (markdown source of truth).
  - Add a GitHub Actions workflow stage that builds the markdown into HTML.
  - Configure GitHub Pages to publish the generated HTML site for Arbiter.
  - Ensure the user guide is linked from appropriate documentation entrypoints
    (README.md or docs index as needed).

  Acceptance Criteria
  - The markdown user guide exists under docs/ and is complete enough for first-time users.
  - CI produces HTML output from the markdown source on every main branch update.
  - GitHub Pages serves the HTML output successfully under the Arbiter repository.
